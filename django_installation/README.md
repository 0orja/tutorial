# Python & Django installation

*This chapter is based on awesome tutorials by Geek Girls Carrots (http://django.carrots.pl/) and django-marcador (http://django-marcador.keimlink.de/).*

## Python Installation

Django is written in Python. We need it to do anything in Django. Let's start with installing it!

### Windows

You can download Python for Windows from website https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/. After downloading ***.msi** file, you should execute it (double-click on it) and follow the instructions there. It is important to remember the path (the folder) where we installed the Python. It will be needed later.

### Linux

It is very probable, that you already have Python installed out of the box. To check if you have it installed (and which version it is), you type in a console:

    $ python --version
    Python 3.4.0

If you don't have Python instaled or you want different version, you can install it as follows.

#### Ubuntu

You type in the console:

    sudo apt-get install python3.4


#### Fedora

Yout type in the console:

    sudo yum install python3.4

### OS X

You need to go to the website https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/ and install the appropriate package for you operating system.
