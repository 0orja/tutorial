# Django installation

*This chapter is based on awesome tutorials by Geek Girls Carrots (http://django.carrots.pl/) and django-marcador (http://django-marcador.keimlink.de/).*

## Virtual environment

Before we will install Django, we will make you install something very handy and useful, that will help you with keeping everything tidy on your computer. It is possible to skip this step, but we think, that you should start with the best setup possible to save a lot of troubles in a future.

That's why we want you to create a Virtual environment (also called `virtualenv`). It will isolate things you do from your computer, so you will have everything important in one place. Neat, right?

All you need to do is find a folder in which you want to create the `virtualenv`, for example your home directory. In Windows it could look like: `C:\Users\Ala\` (where Ala is the name of the user).

### Windows

To create `virtualenv` you need to open command line `cmd` and type there `C:\Python\python -m venv blog`. It will look like this:

    C:\Users\Ala> C:\Python34\python -m venv blog

where `C:\Python34\python` is folder in which you previously installed Python and `blog` is a name of your `virtualenv`. You can use any other name, but stick to lowercase and use no spaces. It is also good idea to keep the name short :).
