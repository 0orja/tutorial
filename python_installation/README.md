# Letâ€™s start with Python

Huh, it's exciting, right?! You'll write your first line of code in just minutes!

But first, let us tell you what Python is. Python is a very popular programming language that can be used for creating websites, games, science, graphics and much, much more.

Python was conceived in the late 1980s and its main goal is to be readable by human beings (not only machines!), which is why it looks much simpler than other programming languages. That makes it easy to learn, but don't worry, Python is also really powerful!

# Python installation

Django is written in Python. We need it to do anything in Django. Let's start with installing it! We want you to install Python 3.4, so if you have any earlier version, you will need to upgrade it.

### Windows

You can download Python for Windows from the website https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.1/. After downloading the ***.msi** file, you should execute it (double-click on it) and follow the instructions there. It is important to remember the path (the folder) where you installed Python. It will be needed later!

### Linux

It is very likely that you already have Python installed out of the box. To check if you have it installed (and which version it is), you type in a console:

    $ python3 --version
    Python 3.4.1

If you don't have Python installed or you want a different version, you can install it as follows.

#### Ubuntu

You type in the console:

    sudo apt-get install python3.4


#### Fedora

You type in the console:

    sudo yum install python3.4

### OS X

You need to go to the website https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-341/ and install the appropriate package for your operating system.
