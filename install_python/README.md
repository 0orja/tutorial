# Letâ€™s start with Python

Huh, it's exciting, right?! You'll write your first line of code in just minutes!

But first, let me tell you what Python is. Python is a very popular programming language that can be used to write websites, games, science, graphics, and many, many more.

Python was conceived in the late 1980s and it's main goal is to be readable by human beings (not only machines!) that's why it looks much simpler than other programming laungages. That also makes it easy to learn, but don't worry, Python is also really powerful!

# Python installation

Django is written in Python. We need it to do anything in Django. Let's start with installing it!

### Windows

You can download Python for Windows from website https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/. After downloading ***.msi** file, you should execute it (double-click on it) and follow the instructions there. It is important to remember the path (the folder) where we installed the Python. It will be needed later.

### Linux

It is very probable, that you already have Python installed out of the box. To check if you have it installed (and which version it is), you type in a console:

    $ python --version
    Python 3.4.0

If you don't have Python instaled or you want different version, you can install it as follows.

#### Ubuntu

You type in the console:

    sudo apt-get install python3.4


#### Fedora

Yout type in the console:

    sudo yum install python3.4

### OS X

You need to go to the website https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/ and install the appropriate package for you operating system.
