if you're not using RunCode Cloud Development environment. If you are, your installation experience will be a little different. 
You can ignore the rest of the installation instructions as you do not need to install anything locally, 
you just need to create three online accounts. 

## About RunCode
RunCode is a cloud development environment which people can use without the need to install Python, Django and Visual 
Studio Code editor locally on their machines. This cloud environment enables anyone to work from any device that has
an internet connection, including cellphones, tablets, laptop or desktop.

This removes the need for you to install packages on a borrowed laptop or the need for you to own a laptop to attend the workshop or follow this tutorial from home. This will also save you time required for setting up your development
environment and you can always do the installation later own as a follow-up after finishing the tutorial.
