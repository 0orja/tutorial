## Introduction
Hey girls, the following steps will show you how to use the black window.  This window is also called the "command line", "cmd" and "terminal".

Each operating system has a set of commands to the black screen.  The Windows system is the most basic version.
Here are some useful commands:

* The **exit** commmand - this will cause the window to close; it makes sense, right? No need to explain a lot ...


* The **cd** command - this command allows you to **c**hange your current **d**irectory. To use the cd command you type cd directoryname and press enter.
For example if you are in a directory called c:\test, and there were three directories in that the test directory called A, B, and C, you could just type **cd A** and press enter. You would then be in the c:\test\A.


* The **cd ..**  command - this will take you back to the next folder up.


* The **dir** command for WIN and **ls** command for other OS - this command will list the files and directories contained in your current directory. If I typed **dir \test** or **ls test** I would see the contents of the c:\test directory.
Also note for many commands you can use the \* symbol which stands for wildcard. With this in mind, typing **dir *.txt** on WIN or **ls *.txt** on other OS will only list those files that end with .txt.


* The **copy** command on WIN or **cp** command on other - this command allows you to copy files from one location to another. To use this command you would type **copy *sourcefile targetfile***. For example if you have the file c:\test\test.txt and would like to copy it to c:\windows\test.txt you would type
**copy c:\test\test.txt c:\windows\test.txt** and press enter.

## What will you learn during the tutorial?

When you'll finish the tutorial, you will have a simple, working web application: your own blog. We will show you how to put it online, so others will see your work!

It will (more or less) look like this:

Ok, let's start at the beginning...
